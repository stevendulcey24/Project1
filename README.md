# Project1
All right well this was my first project

simon is pretty straight forward the computer shows a sequence and the player must them remember the sequence each round the as every round progresses memorizing the sequence usually becomes more and more difficuilt

coming up with functions for the came to actually work was extremely difficuilt for me for example i was really stuck on how to create a random sequence to begin with but eventually me and my friend were able to come up with this ![screenshotofjs](/Screenshot%202022-12-06%20at%208.23.34%20AM.png)
Eventually one one of the main things i would like to work on is making the game more attrative with CSS i feel as if its pretty plain but i honestly did not have the time to add a backgrounds and alot of other things i wouldve really liked to do
